## About me
> I'm a 24 year old who is trying to get out of my current industry and shift into the tech industry. Throughout my time in uni and even afterwards, I had an interest in learning how to code, but never did. I originally started with an application called Grasshopper that taught Java, then took an intro course in my third year of uni, right when the pandemic hit. I didn't pursue it until after my first year in my currnet work where a close friend of mine encouraged me to learn HTML. I learned while working and after the work day, so I'm quite busy at the moment.
